For my navigation component, I first set the background color by accessing the nav element.
I then encompassed the nav with a wrapper so that I could set the max width of just the words in the nav and not the background color.
I then floated the logo left and the unordered list of links right.
I floated each list element left while also adding padding to give each element some separation.
I then set the font properties for the links and set the style to uppercase to match the look of the component.
To make the final touches for this component, I had to use a couple of media queries.
The first one sets the font size and logo size lower.
The second one allowed me to switch the nav over from the five different links to one main link that would let the user access the nav called Menu.
Using these media queries, I was able to make the nav fully responsive and work on any screen size.

For my second component, I first set the max width of the section in order to limit how large the component could get.
I then use a 0 auto margin in order to center the component.
I then set each article to be a width of 25% and to float left.
This allowed me to lay out each element in a row.
Next I added the images above the text.
To do this, I added a background image to each article, told it to not repeat, and centered it in the article.
I then added padding to the headers of each article. 
This allowed me to push the content down so that the image wasn't overlapping with the text.
Then I set the font properties for the headers and the paragraphs, styled the link to have no decoration and be all uppercase.
The final step was to get it mobile friendly.
I used two media queries to do this.
The first set the width of each article to 50% when the screen gets a bit smaller.
After doing this, there was an overlapping issue with the 3rd and 4th article.
To fix this I cleared the float of the 3rd article.
Finally when the screen gets really small I set the width of each article to 100% of its container.

This component was the most challenging for me.
The first step was to set the width and height of the images to fill the articles holding them. That part was easy.
The challenge I faced was positioning the personal information over the image correctly.
I tried to get the content to take up 100% of the article, just like the images.
It would not let me do that however, so I had to adjust the padding for the information based on the window size.
To do this I have a few media queries set at different widths.
Each article is floated left and then it's width is calculated to be 1/3 of the window until it hits a specific width.
Then, using media queries, the grid goes to two per row and eventually one per row.
The personal information was then stylized to be centered over the image and sized accordingly.
The links are all stylized using a background image.
There is just one image that it uses and then I specified the background position for each link.
To access each link individually, I used the nth-child() selector.
The hover transition was pretty simple.
I created a slightly transparent background color, added a transition effect, and set its opacity to 0.
This hides the hover and the personal content until you actually hover over the image. 
At which time the opacity is set to 1 and you see everything.
One major problem I had was the darkened hover was disappearing after the animation was complete.
I did some research and found that setting the position to absolute would fix it.
When I tried that, my entire component broke. So I dug deeper.
Eventually I found the backface-visibility: hidden attribute and that solved all of my problems.
