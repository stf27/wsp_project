                <p id="aboutInfo">Every since I was a child, technology has sparked my interest. I was born and raised in Texas and will probably always live here (go Texas!). My parents raised me to be an outdoor child, but I would have none of that! Any chance I got, I would be fiddling with a computer. This interest lead me to study computer science at Texas A&#38;M. With computer science, I never felt creatively challenged. I found myself wanting more art and design in my life. So now I am studying Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. It has turned out to be just what I was looking for; a mixture of technology and design.</p>

                <a href="http://www.fhoke.com/"><img src="images/blogImages/Nav.PNG"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience for Fhoke is any business (most likely small) looking to create their website. I don't believe there is any preference towards a gender for their target audience. There seems to be a target age for their audience however. The design tells me that they are a young modern design firm looking to help business owners from their 20s up to middle aged people. In other words, they are not targeting people too young to work or people that have retired. They are looking for clients that are business owners.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The focus of this company is to design a website for their client. The client goals/needs of the project would be three things; to earn revenue, to create positive customer service (make the client happy), and to increase their customer base/become more well known. The user goal would be to come out with a great looking product that conveys the style and appeal their target audience is looking for.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The high contrast between bright and dark colors for this component create a modern in your face look and feel. The red background grabs the user's attention while the black type makes it easily read. They component employs the use of a sans-serif font feeding more into that modern design that they are going for. On the left is the company name designed with custom typography successfully creating an image/branding style. On the right are the main navigational points of the page. They are layed out in a line to create a streamlined and efficient user experience.</p>

                <a href="https://squareup.com/reader"><img src="images/blogImages/AboutGeneral.PNG"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience for Squareup are businesses looking to make sales anywhere they go. This would generally apply to smaller companies, as bigger companies can usually afford a more advanced setup. There is no target gender for this product. The target age for their product can be anyone old enough to own a business. It would generally target people 20 and up, but it can be for any business owner (no matter the age).</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for this company would be to generate revenue and keep a happy customer base through top quality customer service. They offer a product that accesses people's personal monetary information. That comes with a lot of responsibility for the company to keep their user's information secure. The user needs stability and reliability. They need the ability to sell their product to a client and know that it is safe and secure and that it will work easily without any technical issues.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this component is to inform the user of what services this company's product provides. The component is broken up into four columns, each detailing different aspects of the square card reader. The company creates a very clean modern look with their design by employing a white background with black text and dark blue icons. The type is a sans-serif which adds to the clean modern look the company is trying to create.</p>

                <a href="http://bkwld.com/profile"><img src="images/blogImages/AboutPeople.jpg"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>BKWLD is a design firm whose audience is centred towards businesses (big and small). There is no preference towards men or women for the target audience. I believe there is a target age for them as well. They deign for business owners which means they have to be anywhere 20 and up. Their audience will usually not be younger than that or old enough to be retired.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for this company would be to increase revenue and build/reach out to a larger audience. Their hope is to design for many different companies and build a large customer base. The user needs could be almost anything, it really depends on the people they are working for and what kind of product they are making for them.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This component is wonderfully simple. It presents the user with a friendly picture of each employee working for the company. It is broken up into a square grid that displays more people in each row depending on the size of the user's screen. When the user hovers over a picture of an employee, they are presented with the name of the employee, their position, and links to all of their social media pages. The font used is a sans-serif adding to the modern clean design. The font and images are white which also adds to the clean design of this component. The image links to social media pages use a rounded blue-green background which adds to the modern feel of the component.</p>

                <h1>Call to Action</h1>
                <a href="http://bixbipet.com/"><img src="images/blogImages/CTA.PNG"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>BIXBI is a company that makes dog treats. Their target audience is dog owners. I don't believe that they are targeting a particular gender. They are going for the modern hip look while creating healthy snacks for your dog. Because of the style and design of their treats, I believe the target age for their audience is young adults (people in their 20s and 30s). However, because of their claim to be natural and healthy, their audience can really be any age.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for this product are to increase revenue, build quality customer service/feedback, and reach out to a larger audience. They hope to create a health product that pets and their owners will love. The user needs are much more basic. They need a trustworthy product that they know is healthy and their dog will enjoy.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The bright colors of this CTA immediately draw attention to itself. The background is yellow which creates a sense of energy and an overall just do it kind of feel (perfect for a CTA). The type is large and bold which helps to draw attention to itself as well. The words are separated by dashed lines creating a sense of hierarchy. The size and layout of the type also adds to this hierarchy. The component also employs a picture of a dog (who appears to be pointing) to draw attention to the information the CTA is presenting. They include a picture of their product as well. It is the same color as the background of the CTA which creates a sense of branding and continuity. At the bottom of the component is a bright orange purchase now button. It is placed after the useful information the CTA presents which creates the idea of, "Hey, we have an awesome product. We know you are sold on it. Here is how you can buy it right now."</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Creative Department is another design agency. Their target audience is small businesses looking to create friendly approachable branding. They do not have a target gender for their work. The target age for their audience is people old enough to work at/own a business.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for Creative Department are the same as most design agencies. They are looking to generate more revenue while building a larger customer base and creating a trustworthy/reliable end product. Their users are typically looking for new branding. Their needs will range greatly but they will all be looking for a design/branding that is high quality and conveys the message they are looking to create.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This is a very simple a straightforward contact form. It has a white background (adding to the simplicity and clean look) and black type mixxed with some green type (which correlates to their brand identity). The layout of the form is set up in a simple and hierarchy which first asks for their name and email, then the message the user is trying communicate, followed by a captcha and a send message button. One thing I really appreciate about the design of this component is the use of the new I'm not a robot checkbox captcha instead of the old style of using barely legible font that the user has to type out to submit something.</p>

                <a href="http://poshcss.com/"><img src="images/blogImages/Blog.PNG"></a>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>POSHCSS is a web blog targeting web designers. They post stories from many different sources with information on web design. There is no target gender for POSHCSS. The title of their site, "For the modern day web designer," leads me to believe that the target age of their audience is younger web designers. But based off of the information that they post, their audience could be any web designer, young or old.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The central client need for POSHCSS is community outreach. They are a website dedicated to spreading information about web design. Their main focus is creating quality content and sharing it with as many people as possible. The user needs information and the latest news on web design. They are looking for quality content with useful information.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this blog is simplicity and ease of use. It accomplishes just that. The colors are very simple; a white background with black text. The links are blue to let the user know it can be clicked (adding to the ease of use). There is a very nice hierarchy set up as well. The user is presented with a big bold title for the website's name and a smaller type describing what the website is for. There are two black lines below that to create a separation from the title and the content of the site. The type is then broken up into different sizes to distinguish between the title of the piece and the content itself.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>MailChimp is a tool that allows people to design visual/creative emails. Their target audience is businesses. They offer a tool that can help them visually convey the company's idea or message. There is not target gender for MailChimp. The target age of their audience is, once again, people old enough to be in business.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs are positive customer service and outreach. They want to offer their service to as many people as they can while continuing to create an easy to use quality service. The user needs are simple. They are looking to create visually beautiful emails with as little work as possible.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>Simplicity is the idea behind this login form. They offer the required fields, let the user know they are required, and allow the user to recover their information if they forgot something. While the form is designed to be simple, there are some great features added to it as well. The form allows the user to show their password to make sure they typed it correctly (which not many forms allow you to do). They also offer the feature to stay logged in. This is all set up in an easy to follow hierarchy. The background is white and the type is black and grey which adds to the simplicity and clean look of the form. The type is a sans-serif which helps create a modern clean look.</p>

                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this component is to help the user find where this company is located. The component presents the user with a map and a pointer indicating the exact location of their office. This visual can really help people figure out where to find the company and what is located around it. Below the map is a dark grey section (correlating to the branding of the site) with a white and light grey type. The type is a sans-serif which all comes together to create a clean and easy to read look and feel.</p>

                <p>Google&#43;'s news feed is designed to deliver the latest news from your friends and companies that you follow. Their target audience is everyone, people of any age and companies of any kind. The purpose of a social media site is to reach as many people as you can no matter race, gender, or age.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs</h2>
                <p>The client needs for Google&#43; are creating positive customer service but more importantly, creating a larger community. They want as many people and businesses to use their service as possible. The user needs are pretty straightforward. They are looking to update themselves with the latest news from the family, friends, and the businesses they follow. All they need is a simple and intuitive layout to read this content.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>The purpose of a news feed is simplicity and legibility. Google&#43; presents the user with just that. The background is a light grey (adding to the simplicity). Each news piece is a white box usually containing an image and some text. The type is a black sans-serif adding to the clean simple look while keeping things easy to read. All of this translates to the idea of giving the user the news they want and doing so as simply and as quickly as possible.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>This is a personal website for a designer by the name Jarad Johnson. It leads you to two companies that he co-founded. One is a design firm and the other a web hosting service. The target audience is anyone looking for those services. There is not target gender. The target age of their audience is generally going to be younger people since the design is built more around the modern look. But really people of any age can use these services.</p>
                <h2>Client and User Needs </h2>
                <p>The client needs for this website is to create a larger community outreach for the two companies that he co-founded. The site is there just to create more awareness. The user needs are also simple. They are visiting the site for information. Information on the person or information the his companies.</p>
                <h2>Critique</h2>
                <p>This components is designed for simplicity. It has a white background with grey images linking to this person's social media pages. The images are lined up in a single row, adding to the simplicity, and creating an easy to read quick to figure out footer. Below the images is a line created to separate (hierarchy) the social media links and the text below it. The text is the same light grey color as that social media images (creating continuity). The font is a serif however. This goes against the idea of simplicity and ease of use (since serif fonts are generally a bit harder to read), but I feel is appropriate since this is a personal website and not a company website. Generally companies like to use sans-serif fonts because they are clean and create a sense of reliability and honesty. While personal websites like to use serif fonts because it makes them more "human" and more personal.</p>
